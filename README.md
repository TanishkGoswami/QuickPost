"# QuickPost" 








left work to do You are absolutely right. I just did a sweep of your codebase, and while the core broadcasting and Auto DM engines are fully built, the SaaS business logic required to actually enforce Strategy 1 is currently missing.

Since your payments are handled externally via the central AIPilot hub (which syncs the plan to your users and hub_subscriptions tables), you don't need to build Stripe from scratch. However, here is exactly what is left to build inside QuickPost to make Strategy 1 a reality:

1. Usage Tracking (Database)
We need a way to track how many posts a user has scheduled in their current billing cycle.

Missing: A user_usage table (or columns) that resets every 30 days to track posts_this_month.
2. Plan Enforcement (Middlewares)
Right now, if a user makes an API request to schedule a post, the server processes it regardless of their plan.

Missing: A middleware in broadcast.js that checks: if (user.plan === 'Free' && posts_this_month >= 30) return res.status(403).json({ error: "Upgrade to schedule more posts" }).
Missing: Logic in the social connections route to block Free users from connecting more than 1 Instagram account.
Missing: Logic in autodm.js to block Free users from saving flows that contain "advanced" nodes (like carousels or delays).
3. Agency "Teams" Architecture
Strategy 1 includes an Agency tier with team members. Right now, your Supabase schema is strictly single-user (one email = one isolated account).

Missing: A workspaces or teams table that allows an Agency owner to invite other emails to manage their connected social accounts.
4. White-Label Reporting
Your platform fetches great analytics, but agencies pay big money for client reports.

Missing: A PDF generation library (like pdfkit or puppeteer) on the backend to export an analytics dashboard with a custom agency logo on it.
Would you like me to start building the Usage Tracking and Plan Enforcement middlewares next? This is the most important first step to actually restricting free users.
